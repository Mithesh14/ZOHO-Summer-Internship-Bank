# TECH STACK

## FRONT END
React is used to do the frontend part of this project. It promotes the development of reusable UI components that display dynamic data. React can power native apps using React Native and can render on the server using Node. The main reason I used react is that it uses virtual DOM (Document Object Model) which is a JavaScript object which is faster than regular DOM. Managers and customers uses two separate UI with different functionalities depending on the role.

## BACK END
NodeJS is used for doing backend part of this project. Node JS is simpler than Java, easier for code writing and ideal for full-stack developers.
